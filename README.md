# Clinical-NLP-Neurodegeneration

🧠 Exploring how language models can assist in detecting early signs of Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and related neurodegenerative conditions.

This project investigates how subtle patterns in language — such as syntactic complexity, semantic drift, or lexical diversity — may help support early diagnosis and disease tracking through **machine learning and natural language processing**.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Identify and clean relevant clinical or linguistic datasets
- Analyze linguistic features that correlate with cognitive decline
- Train baseline ML models to classify samples or track progression
- Experiment with language models (LLMs, transformers, etc.)
- Document the process with a reproducible, research-style approach

---

## 🧪 Technologies & Tools

- Python, Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (to be selected)
- Matplotlib / seaborn for analysis
- GitHub Projects for planning
